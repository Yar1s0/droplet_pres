					<p> Droplet it's not just an ordinary drop of water, he's the hero of our game and like any hero other hero Droplet has a very important mission :
						Save the oceans from the pollution. Marine pollution is a combination of chemicals and trash, most of which comes from land sources and is washed or
						blown into the ocean. This pollution results in damage to the environment, to the health of all organisms, and to economic structures worldwide.
						Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest. Our little friend hope for your help to eliminate and protect the wild ocean in ways that will
						restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. That's why his job is to destroy as many waste as you can to keep the ocean clean.
						Remember: "No water, no life."

			<h1 class="subheading" style="font-family:VT323;font-size: 30px; color: #154360;" >Curiosities about the game</h1>
			<p>Over half a million volunteers participated in the 2016 International Coastal Cleanup, covering a distance of nearly 18,000 miles. The cleanup showed the pressing
				necessity of saving our coasts from further pollution.
				The Ocean Conservancy compiled a list of the top 10 items that were found in this task. Five out of ten were plastic products. In our small game Droplet
				is trying to eliminate the top 4 of this list:

				<h4 class="subheading1" style="font-family:VT323">Straws</h4>
				<p><img src="./PICS/straws.png" style="width:70px;height:70px;margin-right:15px;">
					Plastic straws are on the way out, thankfully. However, the previous damage to the ocean by plastic remains as can be seen by 611,048 straws / stirrers being found
					to litter the ocean.
					Even if plastic straws have no place in our future, there are still hundreds of thousands of them still left in our oceans from our collective past.</p>
			</div><!-- /colg-lg-6 -->
			
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h4 class="subheading1" style="font-family:VT323">Cigarretes</h4>
				<p><img src="./PICS/cigarrete.png" style="width:70px;height:70px;margin-right:15px;">
					The number one item found on the clear-up was cigarettes/ cigarette filters. Over 2,117,000 were found in the coastal clear-up. They
					make their way through drains and gutters and find themselves in the ocean. Animals and birds can mistake the butts for food and ingest them,
					along with the toxins present in cigarettes.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h4 class="subheading1" style="font-family:VT323">Plastic Bags </h4>
				<p><img src="./PICS/plasticbag.png" style="width:70px;height:70px;margin-right:15px;">
					Over a million plastic bags were found in the ocean pollution clear-up. Sea animals are regularly found
					to be tangled up in plastic bags, with some even being choked to death by them.
				</p>
			</div><!-- /colg-lg-6 -->

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h4 class="subheading1" style="font-family:VT323">Beverage Bottles</h4>
				<p><img src="./PICS/villain1.png" style="width:70px;height:70px;margin-right:15px;">
					The number of plastic bottles being sold is predicted to rise even higher in future years.
					Around 20,000 bottles are bought every second which leads to a colossal amount of plastic waste which ends up
					in the ocean. Research by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicts that by 2050 the amount of plastic in the ocean will
					outweigh the amount of fish. Around 1,065,171 beverage bottles were found in the ocean clear-up.
